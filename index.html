        <p>I use my 🖌 (I'm an artist, remember) across frontend, backend and (a bit) of devops. I think it's called
          Full-Stack Developer</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I am not even kidding</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I started my career working on an automated test tool for <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_stability_control">ESC</a> (Electronic Stability Control) in
          cars.
        </p>
        <p>If I were you, I would probably stick to walking, and as far as possible from the road!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I was once a CTO for a SaaS company</p>
        <p>Company made of 2 people, the CEO and the software developer!</p>
        <p>We eventually scaled to a company of 6 people, and that was my introduction to being a leader. Oh boy have I
          learned since then!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I am a technical writer, I like to write about the things I work on!</p>
        <p>I mostly write to myself though</p>
        <p>Here are the only <a
            href="https://dev.to/noejon/setting-up-a-node-js-development-environment-in-2-4eb1">only</a>2 <a
            href="https://dev.to/noejon/copying-a-git-repository-properly-j67">articles</a> I ever wrote (totally forgot
          about the second one TBH)</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I kick ass at writing well tested and maintainable code, reviewing it and automating its deployment</p>
        <p>I'm also great at HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Typescript, JSON, git, etc, etc, etc. I like to think myself as
          adaptable to any
          technology/language</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I am an avid reader. In the past few years I've been reading more than 200 books</p>
        <p>Amongst which you can find Grug, Baby All, My First Book, Peekaboo!</p>
        <p>Far from 200 books, but I wanted to grow as a leader and read lots of books about that. There are a few I
          keep coming back to, The manager's path from Camille Fournier, Resilient Management from Lara Hogan and The
          Coaching Habit from Michael Bungay Stanier</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I take pride in seeing my team members grow and evolve in seniority over time.</p>
        <p>It definitely sparks more joy than tidying up my desk!</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>I'm also a chef level cook, but that probably does not interest you all that much, does it?</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Let's have a look at some badges, shall we?</p>
        <p>You probably did not scroll all that far, I can probably say whatever I want! Cucumber! 🥒</p>
        <p>Well if you are still around, here are the hard stats for you</p>
